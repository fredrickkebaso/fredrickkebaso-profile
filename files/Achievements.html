      <strong>EANBiT MSc Bioinformatics Fellowship (October 2021 – September 2023)</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I was awarded the competitive EANBiT MSc Bioinformatics Fellowship, through which I acquired advanced skills in genomic data analysis, bioinformatics workflow development, and high-throughput sequencing interpretation via intensive coursework, practicum training, and supervised research. This fellowship is part of a collaborative effort among universities and research institutes in Eastern Africa to strengthen bioinformatics training and research mentorship across the region.
