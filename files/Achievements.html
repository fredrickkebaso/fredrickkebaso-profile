        <h3 style="color: #34495e; margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>EANBiT MSc Bioinformatics Fellowship</strong></h3>
        <p>
            I was awarded the Eastern Africa Network for Bioinformatics Training (EANBiT) MSc Bioinformatics Fellowship, a competitive programme supported under the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) initiative. This fellowship is part of a collaborative effort among universities and research institutes in Eastern Africa to strengthen bioinformatics training and research mentorship across the region. EANBiT aims to create a harmonized Master’s curriculum in bioinformatics, support high-quality research project placement, and develop highly trained graduates capable of leading genomic data analysis for health and biomedical research challenges. The training spans advanced coursework, a residential bioinformatics practicum, and supervised research, enhancing skills for complex genomic data interpretation and collaborative research impact.

        <h3 style="color: #34495e; margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>AfricaBP Genomics Biodiversity Fellowship</strong></h3>
        <p>
            I was awarded the Africa BioGenome Project (AfricaBP) Genomics Biodiversity Fellowship. The African BioGenome Project is a pan-African initiative to sequence and understand the genomes of Africa’s rich biological diversity, with strong emphasis on local capacity building, infrastructure development, and training. The fellowship supports emerging genomics leaders in developing expertise in biodiversity genomics, bioinformatics, and applied sequencing technologies. By participating in AfricaBP-affiliated workshops and training activities, fellows contribute to advancing genomic research across multiple African regions and support collaborations that integrate genomics into biodiversity conservation, sustainable agriculture, and economic development.
