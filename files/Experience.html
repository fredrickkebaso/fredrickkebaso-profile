        <h3 style="color: #34495e; margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Bioinformatician</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) – Walter Reed Project (WRP), Kericho, Kenya (August 2025 – Present)</strong></p>
        <p>I conduct viral genome sequencing and perform downstream bioinformatics analyses to study viral diversity and resistance. I develop, optimize, and maintain reproducible bioinformatics pipelines for large-scale genomic data. Additionally, I provide bioinformatics training and technical support to researchers, ensuring accurate data interpretation and fostering capacity building in computational biology.</p>

        <p><strong>International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), Nairobi, Kenya (September 2023 – July 2025)</strong></p>
        <p>At ICIPE, I performed genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation of various insect species. I conducted variant calling, annotation, and functional prediction to identify biologically relevant mutations. I also developed pipelines for metatranscriptomic data analysis and led the camel fly genome annotation hackathon, coordinating team efforts and guiding participants in computational genomics.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #34495e; margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Graduate Research Fellow</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), Nairobi, Kenya (October 2021 – August 2023)</strong></p>
        <p>I led a research project focused on de novo assembly and annotation of chemosensory genes for two Hippobosca species. This involved high-throughput sequencing, genome assembly, gene prediction, and functional annotation to understand olfactory gene evolution in ectoparasites.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #34495e; margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Molecular Bioinformatics Intern</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), Nairobi, Kenya (October 2020 – March 2021)</strong></p>
        <p>I worked under the Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics Unit to build RNA-Seq analysis pipelines. I refined my skills in Nextflow workflow management, Linux command-line operations, Python programming, and R for statistical analysis and data visualization.</p>
