I am a bioinformatician and computational biologist with expertise in genomic data analysis, viral genomics, and workflow development. I specialize in de novo genome assembly, functional annotation, HIV resistance analysis, and metagenomic/metatranscriptomic pipelines. I am proficient in Python, R, Linux, Nextflow, and high-throughput sequencing technologies including Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore.

I have contributed to genomic research projects on HIV, vector biology, and chemosensory gene annotation, developing reproducible pipelines, performing variant analyses, and delivering computational solutions to complex biological questions. I am also passionate about training and mentoring early-career researchers in bioinformatics and advancing the HIV cure agenda through genomics-driven insights.
